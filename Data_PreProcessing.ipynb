Their heads were scaly, some reminiscent of a dragon. When I got out of the cellar I found myself on a town square. It was evening, lights dim with some shadows flying around. Only one shadow was dense and round. It wore a blue and white jacket with a masquerade mask. I provocatively yelled at it \\\"Hey death!\\\" It noticed me and started slowly and ominously chasing me. Suddenly, a girl clad in a celebratory village dress. She said that \\\"It\\u00b4s starting\\\" and took me inside of a room that was connected with the town square. A great iron gate with bars was closed behind me. More girls who had the same dress were inside. Clergymen started a prayer, yet I did not know the words. I felt ashamed, anxious, and the shadow was staring at me hauntingly. Then a dance started, I did not know the moves, I was being pushed around, I even pushed off a glass that broke. Everyone was dancing on the glass shards and clothes that looked like mine that weren't there before. The Clergymen were watching me disapprovingly. The women did not care, they were happy that I was trying to dance with them. After the dance, I started picking up the shards and cut myself accidentally. My blood was not dense, and it was watery. After the cut, my father called me and asked me how I was.\",\n          \"I was in a small drama amphitheatre.

Did it just spring to mind, I guess? Or did something in particular prompt it can you recall? Interesting dream. I guess from a Jungian perspective the girl/s could be seen as your anima symbols, and the dark underground perhaps your deep unconscious. The surprise assassin is an interesting twist. I love how dreams, though supposedly coming from our own minds, can spin a story and lead us to a point without us suspecting what's about to happen, then surprise us! It's like they don't come from our self at all. If characters in dreams should be aspects of ourselves, then if the underground is the unconscious, the assassin motif leads me to consider a repellent/ repressed type behavior. A 'friend' being someone that they are related to, a repressed aspect of ourselves sure, symbolized as someone dormant, sleeping. I guess what you said at the start, that the people below ground, 'we were there to defend ourselves'. That too sounds like the way people judge against/ repress certain traits, as when people try to repress an aggressive side to survive in polite society.\",\n          \"The Tractor.: Maybe your conscience? It has no front wheels therefore it\\u2019s designed not to steer to the left or the right just forward and reverse and keep you on tracks d give you great traction. The 2 functions may simply be right wrong? The large wheels enable traction for daily life when applied daily. At the first the Tractor is anchored on solid ground by the sea (sub conscience) the tractor was originally above sea level where the conscience is supposed to be to help us out with our daily living to make good decisions on a daily basis. But over time time we notice the tractor has become submerged. What caused the tractor to get submerged? If the tractor is the conscience then it has a daily function to help us get through each day providing traction for our daily work? Then at night it rests as we sleep and the sub conscience takes over. This cycle is performed on a daily basis just like the sea. The sea also has a daily rhythm, the tide goes out the tide comes in each day. If the tractor is your conscience but not been in operation because of other activities then it will slowly cease to function. The tractor is anchored to the bank with a quick release clip so as to enable it to be unhitched with ease each day to drive into the sea and face the day? Then when the tide goes out again you simply reverse yourself back up onto the bank and rest until tomorrow till the new day begins and start all over again? But why is your tractor submerged? Again, if the tractor is your conscience it may well be you have neglected to come out and face some of your new days thus leaving your tractor anchored in the one place on the beach? It\\u2019s possible that the forces of nature of life itself have altered the mean level of the normal level of your tidal activity thereby flooding your tractor when not in use? When the tractor is in daily use we can be aware of the rising tide each day and make the appropriate adjustments of how far back you need to park it so that it doesn\\u2019t submerge when you awake ready for a new day? Having been neglected for some time (time passed) perhaps living in the past the tide has simply crept up on you because as you say yourself you\\u2019ve been \\u201csleeping a lot lately) This sleeping may be a distraction causing you to miss the daily tides? The tractor needs to be above sea level not under it. You need it to sort through your daily life and of a night when the tide goes out your sub conscience will continue to assist you as you sleep? You can\\u2019t have the tractor submerged.This has happened before but you\\u2019ve seen what other people have done when this happens, they (perhaps your maintenance crew simply go in and perhaps give your tractor an overhaul so it can get started again. This may be seen as a wake up call to wake you up a bit? Once the machine has been serviced and running again it\\u2019s time for you to reverse it back to saftey up on the new tidal mark on the bank and as a safety precaution you might anchor it off until tomorrow comes when it is nice and rested waiting for the new and rising tide of the new day? This must be repeated daily. Once you miss a few tides you are then in danger of being submerged again.\\nThe distraction that caused you to allow the Tractor to get submerged: Just a guess here but it\\u2019s possible that you\\u2019ve been spending a lot of time on your \\u201cdream life\\u201d the place is \\u201cidyllic\\u201d that is it seems perfect for you away from the daily rough and tumble of the sea? The place itself is in the countryside with a small building housing various crafts and pottery and it\\u2019s nice and sunny convenient to assist with the pottery? Here we possibly see the other end of your spectrum? On one hand the daily tides of life with the big decisions you need to make each day just to get through then on the other hand an ideal place in the country where you can sleep to your hearts content and be creative with your crafts and pottery in the sunny countryside. This setting is idyllic and well suited to you because the crafts relax you and you must feel at peace with yourself in this ideal setting (no big tractor here no big decisions) this idyllic place is so peaceful for you that it has caused you to sleep too much, loosing time away from the real world possibly because you may need a certain amount of rest in your life.\\nThe plastic clip: This is a quick release mechanism designed to be secured and unsecured with ease. The original old tractors had their implements bolted on and it was hard going to change them so they just left them on rendering the use of the tractor to only one job. Then came the 3 point Linkage set up, then what is called the quick hitch set up which allowed the operator to change the function of the tractor very quickly making it a more versatile peice of equipment all because of the quick hitch system. So to we see your quick hitch system in the plastic clip? I\\u2019m still trying to figure this out but even as you yourself have noticed that the plastic clip and piece of string is far too feeble to hold back the big tractor? I\\u2019m just wondering about the crafts and pottery, what they represent to you? This idyllic project seems to have the effect of at least trying to anchor your tractor from moving sometimes? Your distraction may be seen as in the string as your attachment to your crafts using it to anchor your conscience to save it from entering the new day and making the decisions needed to get through the day in other words it gives the conscience a break, a rest. Even though the tractor is very powerful and provides all the traction we need to get through each day it still needs to be used, it cannot be neglected. The plastic clip and piece of string may be your connection to your very relaxing crafts and pottery and as we realise is not strong enough to stop the tractor from becoming submerged should the rising tide come in higher than the average? It does provide great traction for life only when it is in operation each day? It\\u2019s possible your dream is showing you about balance by showing you how easy it is to disengage from one part of your life so that you don\\u2019t suffer loss in another part of your life??? If this is so then your dream is asking you to keep and eye on the daily tides and be prepared for them each day when they come in. Also not to over indulge in the idyllic sunny countryside when you get too much relaxation and fall asleep??? Eves comments on the wetsuit to keep you from getting too much of a shock when you decide to \\u201c dive in\\u201d and retrieve your tractor are great.\\nThe clip and the string: The string may represent your tie to crafts and art and is seen as your attempt to create a relaxing connection to anchor the tractor. The plastic quick release although manufactured from natural products has undergone a lot of change just like the new and modern quick hitch system for the tractor. This modern and clever little clip allows you to quickly change your needed connection to be appropriately involved in the changing rhythm of your days. The tractor can be used for many purposes when it connects the right implements. Your little plastic clip cannot always hold the tractor back. It\\u2019s designed to unclip as well but when the time is right quickly and effortlessly clip back up again.\",\n          \"In my opinion, this is you coming to a different state of healing.

The next night i had a dream where my mum was holding a baby girl and i said who\\u2019s baby is that and she gave it to me and said it\\u2019s your brothers and i was like \\u201ci knew he was gonna have a baby because i had a dream that my little brother was designing a room and there were two kids beds in there\\u201d like what?? And then the next night i had a dream and there was a baby girl in it again.\",\n          \"In the dream, I bought a house. I was in a different country, though I don\\u2019t know which ones. From the outside, it seemed tiny, dainty. Inside it was beautiful. Each floor was very small, painted lavender, and there were maybe about seven stories. Like my own personal tower. The rooms were full of furniture from the previous owner. It started off amazing. Me, my mother (my mother lives in another country) and my best friend and her husband were cleaning the place out. I was keeping the furniture I did want, giving away others. One the rooms was a children\\u2019s room, with a small bed and a crib, both made of golden coloured metal. I gave the crib to my friend, as in my dream she was either newly pregnant or trying for a baby. As we were emptying that room, someone got a call that a local boy had been kicked out of his house by his awful father. We all knew of him. I told her to tell the kid he could stay here, in this room until he could go home or figure something out. The boy never showed up in the dream, but somewhere around that conversation is when things started to go wrong. My friend took a shower and saw someone looking at her from the drain. We checked every drain, and every drain in the house had someone looking through it. Like all you could see was the eyeball, looking up. The floorboards were suddenly rotten, they looked fine, but I\\u2019d step on them and they\\u2019d start to collapse down. I fell through the floor and into the basement of the house. I contacted an insurance agent, and when I explained the issues he started to laugh, hysterically. Then that scene disappeared and suddenly I was someone else, a teen girl, trying desperately to pretend I went to a school I know I didn\\u2019t, trying to get this group of people to let me go somewhere with them. And not in the way of a teen just wanting to be included, they were doing something dangerous or bad and this girl, for some reason, needed to gain their trust, have them underestimate her, so she could find out what it was. It felt like her life depended on it. They ended up letting her tag along, but I woke up as soon as they started to walk away with her.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"comment_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 317,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"It seems you have been on some sort of journey where perhaps you may have been a little lost in life? But now it\\u2019s here in the hospital room where you receive the care and recover. The recovery consisting of revelation about yourself. You say you don\\u2019t know how you got there or why you are there? I had a dream once where I was all but dead and buried underground in a maze of warrens etc. Then an ambulance turns up with 3 hospital attendants, 2 bearing a stretcher and one leading the way. They sort of made their way to where I was buried in the Warren, rescued me, carried me out on the stretcher , placed me in the ambulance and took me to hospital. For me the hospital staff were angels of god who came to rescue me from my life situation. For me the hospital I was taken too was church where I was well cared for and recovered. Sometimes we don\\u2019t understand what happens , how we are cared for but it happens. In your dream you also find yourself in hospital, a place to be cared for a place to recover. We notice your situation is \\u201cpleasant\\u201d you are at ease and relaxed, also \\u201csunny\\u201d suggesting your outlook on life is good and the atmosphere of the sun is healing. You are not scared, \\u201ccalm and fully ok with the situation and almost content\\u201d so in fact your hospital whatever it represents to you is a great place for you in your life right now.\\nWhile in the hospital you have 2 visitors, a partner from the present and a partner from your past. These 2 partners are a part of you. It looks as if some kind of reconciliation is going on between your past life and present life represented by the 2 loving and caring partners. The 2 partners are not causing distress but rather \\u201caffection\\u201d These 2 visits may represent a reconciliation between past and present bringing together the healing you require Also you speak of the left and right hemisphere in your brain again we see this balancing going on for you between left and right past and present. The hemisphere you speak of is the horizon or the equator between the earthly and celestial, another set of opposites as with the present and the past partners.

You feel this intimately (sexually) as if her problems are being cum-ed onto you. But you also care about her, because she is your sister. It's because you care so much about her that you feel her issues so intimately. Due to her inappropriate behaviors, you think she will end up \\\"dead\\\" somehow and pay for her obscenities by being on display. And of course you feel sad, because you love your sister. I think the gum represents crap that you can't seem to get out of your mouth (or life). Much like the cum that your sister jerked out.

I start to flip and cry and they laugh at me and he tells me this isn\\u2019t the first time he cheated on me. This is the second time I\\u2019ve had this dream. Except the first time, it was a dream of me seeing his phone with a blonde girl flirting with him and him flirting back.\",\n          \"I\\u2019ve had a dream 3 nights in a row about a baby girl, the first one my little brother was in the computer designing a room for my older brother and my little brother asked me to come see if it was good so i go and look and i said it needs a tv also why is there two kids beds in here and my mum said that my brother is gonna have a baby and my mums gonna help look after it. The next night i had a dream where my mum was holding a baby girl and i said who\\u2019s baby is that and she gave it to me and said it\\u2019s your brothers and i was like \\u201ci knew he was gonna have a baby because i had a dream that my little brother was designing a room and there were two kids beds in there\\u201d like what?? And then the next night i had a dream and there was a baby girl in it again.\",\n          \"In the dream, I bought a house. I was in a different country, though I don\\u2019t know which ones. From the outside, it seemed tiny, dainty. Inside it was beautiful. Each floor was very small, painted lavender, and there were maybe about seven stories. Like my own personal tower. The rooms were full of furniture from the previous owner. It started off amazing. Me, my mother (my mother lives in another country) and my best friend and her husband were cleaning the place out. I was keeping the furniture I did want, giving away others. One the rooms was a children\\u2019s room, with a small bed and a crib, both made of golden coloured metal. I gave the crib to my friend, as in my dream she was either newly pregnant or trying for a baby. As we were emptying that room, someone got a call that a local boy had been kicked out of his house by his awful father. We all knew of him. I told her to tell the kid he could stay here, in this room until he could go home or figure something out. The boy never showed up in the dream, but somewhere around that conversation is when things started to go wrong. My friend took a shower and saw someone looking at her from the drain. We checked every drain, and every drain in the house had someone looking through it. Like all you could see was the eyeball, looking up. The floorboards were suddenly rotten, they looked fine, but I\\u2019d step on them and they\\u2019d start to collapse down. I fell through the floor and into the basement of the house. I contacted an insurance agent, and when I explained the issues he started to laugh, hysterically. Then that scene disappeared and suddenly I was someone else, a teen girl, trying desperately to pretend I went to a school I know I didn\\u2019t, trying to get this group of people to let me go somewhere with them.

But now it\\u2019s here in the hospital room where you receive the care and recover. The recovery consisting of revelation about yourself. You say you don\\u2019t know how you got there or why you are there? I had a dream once where I was all but dead and buried underground in a maze of warrens etc. Then an ambulance turns up with 3 hospital attendants, 2 bearing a stretcher and one leading the way. They sort of made their way to where I was buried in the Warren, rescued me, carried me out on the stretcher , placed me in the ambulance and took me to hospital. For me the hospital staff were angels of god who came to rescue me from my life situation. For me the hospital I was taken too was church where I was well cared for and recovered. Sometimes we don\\u2019t understand what happens , how we are cared for but it happens. In your dream you also find yourself in hospital, a place to be cared for a place to recover. We notice your situation is \\u201cpleasant\\u201d you are at ease and relaxed, also \\u201csunny\\u201d suggesting your outlook on life is good and the atmosphere of the sun is healing. You are not scared, \\u201ccalm and fully ok with the situation and almost content\\u201d so in fact your hospital whatever it represents to you is a great place for you in your life right now.\\nWhile in the hospital you have 2 visitors, a partner from the present and a partner from your past. These 2 partners are a part of you. It looks as if some kind of reconciliation is going on between your past life and present life represented by the 2 loving and caring partners. The 2 partners are not causing distress but rather \\u201caffection\\u201d These 2 visits may represent a reconciliation between past and present bringing together the healing you require Also you speak of the left and right hemisphere in your brain again we see this balancing going on for you between left and right past and present. The hemisphere you speak of is the horizon or the equator between the earthly and celestial, another set of opposites as with the present and the past partners. So we have a past and present and earthly and heavenly?\",\n          \"My interpretation is that you find your sister obscene and inappropriate. You feel this intimately (sexually) as if her problems are being cum-ed onto you. But you also care about her, because she is your sister. It's because you care so much about her that you feel her issues so intimately. Due to her inappropriate behaviors, you think she will end up \\\"dead\\\" somehow and pay for her obscenities by being on display. And of course you feel sad, because you love your sister.

So my friend and I are walking smoking a joint and talking \\u201ccan\\u2019t remember a thing about the conversation\\u201d anyway I decide I\\u2019m jumping off the plato and tell my buddy he agrees it\\u2019s the right thing to do so we jump. It was as amazing as I thought it would be everything was so pretty. Then a dolphin swam close to us and let us pet it I decided I\\u2019m riding this damn thing so I grab it\\u2019s top fin and away we go he took me all over showing me all the beautiful things it was great I was having such a good time after a while I thought man I\\u2019m hogging the dolphin Marky needs to do this too so we go back to my friend and I let him have a turn. That\\u2019s when it went down I guess the dolphin didn\\u2019t like my buddy cause he started ramming him knocking him out of the water and there\\u2019s nothing I can do I have no weapon and you can\\u2019t fight a dolphin in water with no weapon and win so I\\u2019m terrified my buddies limp body just getting thrashed and nothing I can do about it then I woke up.

Suddenly there was ice everywhere and we were all trapped on a set of metal stairs leading up to the flight deck. It was freezing and we couldn't move. I began to sob hysterically and dropped to the floor that was icy cold. I wanted to die and get it over with, so much that I almost jumped from the railing but was stopped by a random guy.

It was as amazing as I thought it would be everything was so pretty. Then a dolphin swam close to us and let us pet it I decided I\\u2019m riding this damn thing so I grab it\\u2019s top fin and away we go he took me all over showing me all the beautiful things it was great I was having such a good time after a while I thought man I\\u2019m hogging the dolphin Marky needs to do this too so we go back to my friend and I let him have a turn. That\\u2019s when it went down I guess the dolphin didn\\u2019t like my buddy cause he started ramming him knocking him out of the water and there\\u2019s nothing I can do I have no weapon and you can\\u2019t fight a dolphin in water with no weapon and win so I\\u2019m terrified my buddies limp body just getting thrashed and nothing I can do about it then I woke up.

Suddenly there was ice everywhere and we were all trapped on a set of metal stairs leading up to the flight deck. It was freezing and we couldn't move.

So my friend and I are walking smoking a joint and talking \\u201ccan\\u2019t remember a thing about the conversation\\u201d anyway I decide I\\u2019m jumping off the plato and tell my buddy he agrees it\\u2019s the right thing to do so we jump. It was as amazing as I thought it would be everything was so pretty. Then a dolphin swam close to us and let us pet it I decided I\\u2019m riding this damn thing so I grab it\\u2019s top fin and away we go he took me all over showing me all the beautiful things it was great I was having such a good time after a while I thought man I\\u2019m hogging the dolphin Marky needs to do this too so we go back to my friend and I let him have a turn. That\\u2019s when it went down I guess the dolphin didn\\u2019t like my buddy cause he started ramming him knocking him out of the water and there\\u2019s nothing I can do I have no weapon and you can\\u2019t fight a dolphin in water with no weapon and win so I\\u2019m terrified my buddies limp body just getting thrashed and nothing I can do about it then I woke up.

Suddenly there was ice everywhere and we were all trapped on a set of metal stairs leading up to the flight deck. It was freezing and we couldn't move.

I run to the kitchen to get a large cup just to slow the smoldering. But the water pressure is low and it\\u2019s taking forever. I fill the cup as much as I can and run to extinguish the fire. I keep going back for more water, and eventually find that the foam is smoldering near the floor, so I focus my attention there.

Grandmother has died, and this is either my inheritance, or things that were already mine but kept in her house. My parents are packing up and sorting things in other parts of the house. When my father asks me if I am ready to leave, I ask for more time. He takes note of my short black skirt and asks if it is new. I answer that it is. All of my clothing is black, possibly because I am in mourning. He then goes off to some other part of the house to continue his sorting. I am sitting down on the floor to continue looking at the various objects, loosing myself in memories. My skirt is now a a short red kilt. I adjust my thick black stockings, pulling them up over my knees, more for warmth than anything else. One of the objects I remember is a dark wooden statue of St. Peter holding a key, which I have in fact inherited from my grandmother in waking life. It used to stand in her living room. When my father comes back a couple of hours later, he is noticeable annoyed that I am taking so much time. He is almost done sorting and packing. I tell him that I am now done and we can go. He can either drive me home, or I can take the subway. As he drives me to their house, he continues ranting about how much time I took. At the time we have reached my parents house, I have had enough and start shouting at him that he didn\\u2019t have to wait for me. He could just have gone home if he wanted, but now he has gotten more done today than expected, so he should thank me rather than complain. He now looks confused and asks me we he should be grateful to me. I wake up and my cat walks over my chest. As I fall asleep again, I am standing in front of a huge door. I am in a city together with some students. I open the door and enter into a relatively small room. The walls appear to be covered in dark red leather. I know that I am here to see the Queen. As I am waiting to be shown into the next room, I become very self-conscious about the short skirt I am wearing (a miniskirt in dark green leather), and check that it covers me from behind as well. I exit the room through a door to my right. Now I am in a museum of history, together with the students, showing them around an exhibition with black-and-white photographs. ;  Background_Info: __ ;  Wakeup_State: __\",\n          \"Dream_Text: Some people were torturing a Bison.
